        <h2>Development</h2>
        <p class="text">
            "Winnie-the-Pooh," as he was originally called, first appeared in a story written by A.A. Milne, who based
            the characters off his young owner Christopher Robin Milne and the boy's stuffed animals. The original toy
            bear was named after Winnie (short for "Winnipeg"), a bear that had been adopted as a cub by a Canadian
            soldier during World War I, who was a popular attraction at the London Zoo. The stories were popular in the
            Disney household, motivating Walt to start production on a series of featurettes starring the honey-obsessed
            bear and his collection of friends.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2>Personality</h2>
        <p class="text">Pooh is described as being "a bear of very little brain." He is generally kind and friendly
            towards everyone
            and has a demeanor that is childlike and innocent. Because of his limited intelligence, however, Pooh is
            extremely naive. Absent-minded and simple, he tends to process things at a slower pace than his friends, to
            the point of seeming disoriented. Pooh's sluggish nature also makes him somewhat passive in most
            situations.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2>Physical appearance</h2>
        <p class="text">Pooh is an anthropomorphic teddy bear. He is short, has yellow fur, and a round belly. He has
            black dot eyes,
            a black nose, a short snout, and small round ears. There is also stitching on his belly and bottom, which
            occasionally rips open. He only wears a small red short-sleeved shirt, in which his belly hangs out of.

        <h2>The Tigger Movie</h2>
        <p class="text">
            At the start of the film, the narrator declares it to be another story about Winnie the Pooh until a
            frustrated Tigger interrupts. Having grown tired of every story revolving around Pooh, Tigger suggests that
            the new book should focus on him, to which the narrator obliges. When Pooh is first introduced, he is busy
            gathering enough honey to last the winter, until Tigger bursts in, asking to go bouncing. Unfortunately,
            Pooh was too busy.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2>Piglet's Big Movie</h2>
        <p class="text">During a plan to obtain honey from the bees, Piglet makes several attempts to join his friends
            eventually saving them from the bees after their plan failed. Pooh gives credit only to Tigger, Rabbit, and
            Eeyore unaware of Piglet's actions. Pooh and friends learn Piglet is missing and to them for unknown
            reasons. Pooh uses Piglet's scrapbook to track him down eventually realizing how big a hero Piglet truly is.
            Soon enough the book is accidentally dismantled by Rabbit and Tigger. The friends track most pages, but the
            cover and a few more pages are dangling over a log in a dangerous pose. Pooh, not caring about the danger,
            goes after it anyway and nearly falls to his death. At the last minute, he is rescued by Piglet. The group
            is safe and the throw an appreciation party for their heroic friend.

        <h2>Pooh's Heffalump Movie</h2>
        <p class="text">A mysterious intruder has entered the Hundred Acre Woods and Rabbit knows there's only one thing
            it could be a Heffalump. To protect the woods, Pooh and his pals gather all the furniture, tools and honey
            they can find. The expedition begins the next morning. Piglet uses jellybeans to remember the way home but
            is eaten by Pooh the minute they touch the ground. Pooh and Piglet are lost and separated from the group.

        <h2>Winnie the Pooh</h2>
        <p class="text">It is a regular morning in the Hundred Acre Woods and to Pooh seems like a great day until he
            finds himself out of honey. He goes out to find some in during which he runs from bees and screws up some of
            the text and eventually runs into a depressed Eeyore. Pooh's friend has yet again lost his tail and to learn
            what to do, Pooh and his friend go to Owl. The first thing to do is issue a reward for the finding of the
            tail, says the wise bird. The session is briefly interrupted when Pooh strongly believes Owl's caught a
            cold. Shortly after, Christopher Robin sets a contest for the finding of the tail. The winner gets a pot of
            honey. Pooh is then given the task to alert the woods that there is a very important thing to do. While he's
            out, Pooh runs into Tigger who attacks the balloon Pooh is holding. The balloon is attracted to the fur of
            Tigger which frightens him. Pooh claims the balloon wants to stay with Tigger who then suggests having him
            become a sidekick until he begins to worry about something wrong happening to him.
        </p>

        <h2>Christopher Robin</h2>
        <p class="text">Pooh plays the central role in the live-action film wherein a now adult Christopher Robin lives
            in London with his wife and daughter. After reuniting during a particularly low point of Christopher's life,
            Pooh fears that his friend has lost his way. Back in the Hundred Acre Woods, Pooh bands together Tigger,
            Piglet, and Eeyore to travel to London in order to save Christopher Robin. Jim Cummings is the only
            returning actor of the animated voice cast, reprising his role as Pooh (and Tigger). Physically, Pooh has
            aged significantlyâ€”he has lost some of the hues in his color and has notable wears and tears across his
            plush figure.
